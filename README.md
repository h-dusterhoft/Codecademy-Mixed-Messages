# Codecademy's Mixed-Messages Portfolio Assignment
Project assignment: build a random message generator program using Javascript. 

## Description:
This project is designed to generate a random message describing the user's mood, and what they should wear, watch, eat, and drink as a result of their mood.
The random message options were stored in value arrays within an object. 
The function would iterate randomly through the options and return a random joined string of the mood / action combination. 

## Requirements:
